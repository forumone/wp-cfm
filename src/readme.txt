Manage and deploy WordPress configuration changes

== Description ==

WP-CFM lets you copy database configuration to / from the filesystem. Easily deploy configuration changes without needing to copy the entire database. WP-CFM is similar to Drupal's Features module.

= How will WP-CFM benefit me? =

* Less need to copy over the entire database.
* No more rushing to figure out which settings you forgot to change.
* Easily track and version configuration changes via git, subversion, etc.

= Which data does WP-CFM support? =

* WP settings (`wp_options` table)
* Multisite settings (`wp_sitemeta` table)
* Taxonomy terms
* Custom Field Suite field groups

= Terminology =

* Bundle - A group of (one or more) settings to track
* Push - Export database settings to the filesystem
* Pull - Import file-based settings into the database

= WP-CLI =

WP-CFM supports [pull / push / diff] of bundles from the command-line using [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/):

<pre>
wp config pull [bundle_name]
wp config push [bundle_name]
wp config diff [bundle_name]
wp config bundles
wp config show_bundle [bundle_name]
</pre>

You can optionally set `bundle_name` to "all" to include all bundles.

Append the `--network` flag to include multisite bundles.

= How to add custom configuration =

<pre>
add_filter( 'wpcfm_configuration_items', 'my_configuration_items' );
add_filter( 'wpcfm_pull_callback', 'my_pull_callback' );


/**
 * Register custom settings
 *
 * @param array $items Associative array of configuration items
 * @return array
 */
function my_configuration_items( $items ) {
    $items['myprefix_data'] = array(
        'value'     => 'YOUR CONFIGURATION DATA',
        'label'     => 'The value label', // optional
        'group'     => 'The Group Name', // optional
    );
    return $items;
}


/**
 * Tell WP-CFM how to import custom settings
 *
 * $params['name']          The option name
 * $params['group']         The option group
 * $params['old_value']     The current DB value that will get overwritten
 * $params['new_value']     The new DB value
 */
function my_pull_callback( $params ) {
    if ( 'myprefix_data' == $params['name'] ) {
        // Import the data
    }
}
</pre>
